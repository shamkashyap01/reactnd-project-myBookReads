# MyReads Project

Project Purpose:

This game was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. 
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* builds the app in prod with `npm run build`

## Backend Server
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. 
That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## API's
Udacity has provided a set of apis which can be found in the file BooksAPI.js
